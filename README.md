## Preface
This is a practical example of hexagonal architecture. The goals of this little project are to identify and describe patters useful with this kind of architectures. I believe that CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is the easiest form of hexagonal architecture to implement, therefore my approach uses this paradigm.

The project is organized in source modules, these fall into three major categories:
* `domain`
* `app`lication
* `infra`structure

![General concepts](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.github.com/maciejmalecki/inventory/develop/doc/dia/general.puml)

The category to which given module belongs determines dependencies that are allowed for that module. The categories in fact form an onion-like structure, where domain modules are located in the centre and infrastructure modules belong to the most outer layer. Dependencies always point inwards.

## Domain
![Domain of items](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.github.com/maciejmalecki/inventory/develop/doc/dia/domain/items.puml)

## Dependency model
![Dependencies for packages](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.github.com/maciejmalecki/inventory/develop/doc/dia/packages.puml)
![Dependencies for classes](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.github.com/maciejmalecki/inventory/develop/doc/dia/zerodependency.puml)
