== Preface

The goal of this document is to propose a generic model of enterprise application architecture. There are a few principles that the model should fulfil:

Zero dependency:: Architecture avoids tight coupling with technical libraries and frameworks.
Reduced ripple effect:: The maintenance efforts scales well with the application size, i.e. there are no combinatorial effects on changes in this architecture.
Self describing:: So-called _screaming architecture_ -- that is by a folder and source file structure it becomes apparent what purpose the application serves and where to find existing or create new code artefacts.

== Abstraction layers

The model foresees at least three abstraction layers:

Domain:: Contains code artefacts solely connected with business domain.
Application:: Contains code artefacts connected with application logic.
Infrastructure:: Contains code artefacts that realize concrete technical solutions such as web applications, batch processes, event processors, storage implementations, etc.
